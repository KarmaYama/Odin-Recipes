    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This mac and cheese hack is as simple as picking up two ingredients from Trader Joe's: pasta and the Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread. It has become wildly popular across TikTok, and all it requires you to do is stir the cheese spread into freshly cooked, very hot pasta. In mere moments, a creamy, thick consistency formsâ€”the spread finds its way into every nook and cranny of the pasta for one melty, warm, cheesy bite after another. And voila! You have yourself a pot of delicious mac and cheese the entire family can enjoy any night of the week.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of dried pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread (more if you want it extra cheesy and rich!)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain and return the pasta to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread and 1-2 tablespoons of pasta water at a time until you reach your desired consistency. (Tip: you're looking for that ASMR pasta sound).</li>
    </ol>
