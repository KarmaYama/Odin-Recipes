    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There is nothing I love more than a recipe that is easy, this sausage and chorizo casserole is quick and one the whole family will love. As a busy parent, it’s so important for us to come together at dinner time and really get a chance to catch up and share our day. The last thing I want to do is slave over a complex recipe and waste that precious time at the table with my family. Like all my recipes on Let’s Talk Mommy, they are super easy, all family friendly and quick to throw together. This helps make more family time at the table together.
